    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential application of reinforcement learning involves ordering supplies with mutliple suppliers having various lead times and costs in order to meet a changing demand.  Lead time in inventory management is the lapse in time between when an order is placed to replenish inventory and when the order is received.  This affects the amount of stock a supplier needs to hold at any point in time.  Moreover, due to having multiple suppliers, at every stage the supplier is faced with a decision on how much to order from each supplier, noting that more costly suppliers might have to be used to replenish the inventory from a shorter lead time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inventory control model addresses this by modeling an environment where there are multiplie suppliers with different costs and lead times. Orders must be placed with these suppliers to have an on-hand inventory to meet a changing demand. However, both having supplies on backorder and holding unused inventory have associated costs. The goal of the agent is to choose the amount to order from each supplier to maximize the revenue earned. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, an order is placed to each supplier. If previous orders have waited for the length of their supplier's lead time, then these orders will become part of the on-hand inventory. The demand is then randomly chosen from a user-selected distribution and is subtracted from the on-hand inventory. If the on-hand inventory would become less than zero, than items are considered to be on backorder which decreases the reward. The demand is subtracted from the on-hand inventory to calculate on-hand inventory for the start of the next time step. A remaining inventory (a positive nonzero number) at the end of this calculation negatively influences the reward proportional to the holding costs. There are two ways that the inventory can be setup for the environment. The first allows negative inventory to be accumulated. In this case the on-hand inventory is offset by adding the value of the maximum inventory. This is done so that the observation space can be properly represented using AI Gym. This allows for backorder costs to be calculated if the inventory were to go become negative. The second way does not allow for inventory to become negative. Backorders are still calculated and they still negatively influence reward, but the inventory is reset to 0 for the next timestep after the reward calculation. The inventory is not offset by any number in this version of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Assumptions\n",
    "* Backorders are not retroactively fulfilled. If a high demand would cause inventory to become negative, this unfulfilled demand is not met later when there may be some inventory being held at the end of a timestep."

    "## Environment\n",
    "### Dynamics\n",
    "#### State Space\n",
    "The state space is $S = [0,\\text{Max-Order}]^{L_1} \\times [0,\\text{Max-Order}]^{L_2} \\times ... \\times [0,\\text{Max-Order}]^{L_N} \\times I$ where $N$ is the number of suppliers and $[0,\\text{Max-Order}]^{L_i}$ represents a list of integers between zero and the max order amount, maxorder (specified in the configuration), with the length of the lead time of supplier $i$. This represents how many timesteps back each order is from being added to the inventory. $I$ represents the current on-hand inventory.  To represent a timestep, an order will be moved up an index in the array unless it is added to the inventory, in which case it is removed from the array. Each supplier has their own set of indices in the array that represent its lead times. Each index in the list (except for $ I $) has a maximum value of the max_order parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "If negative inventory is allowed, the last index, the on-hand inventory, is offset by adding the maximum inventory value to it. It is in the range $[0, 2 * maxinventory]$ This is done so that a negative value of the on-hand inventory can be temporarily kept to use in reward calculations for backorders and so that the observation space can be represented properly. Before this value is used in any calculations, the value of the max inventory is subtracted so that the true value of the inventory is used. Otherwise if negative inventory is not allowed, the on-hand inventory must be in the range of $[0,maxinventory]$ and directly corresponds to the current inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Space\n",
    "The action space is $A = [0,\\text{Max-Order}]^N$ where N is the number of suppliers. This represents the amount to order from each supplier for the current timestep. The order amount cannot be greater than the max_order paramter (set in the initialization of the environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward\n",
    "The reward is $R = - (Order + holdcost \\times max(0,I) + backordercost \\times max(0, -I))$ where $Order = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} c_i \\times a_i$ and represents the sum of the amount most recently ordered from each supplier, $a_i$,  multiplied by the appropriate ordering cost, $c_i$. $holdcost$ represents the holding cost for excess inventory, and $backordercost$ represents the backorder cost for when the inventory would become negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transitions\n",
    "At each timestep, orders are placed into each supplier for a certain amount of resources. These orders are processed and will add to the on-hand inventory once the lead time for the appropriate supplier has passed. The time that has passed for each order is trakced using the state at each timestep. If any lead times have passed, the ordered amount is added to the on-hand inventory. Then, the randomly chosen demand is subtracted from the on-hand inventory. If the demand is higher than the current inventory, then the inventory does become negative for the next state. The reward is then calculated proportional to the revenue earned from meeting the demand, but is inversely proportional to the amount that is backordered (the difference between the inventory and demand). If the demand is lower than the current inventory, the inventory remains positive for the next state. The reward is still proportional to the revenue earned from meeting the demand, but is inversely proportional to the amount of inventory left over multiplied by the holding costs. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Random Agent\n",
    "This agent randomly samples from the action space. For this environment, the amount ordered from each supplier is an integer from $[0, maxorder]$.\n",
    "### Base Surge Agent (TBS)\n",
    "The base surge agent has 2 parameters, $r$ and $S$. Each action is expressed as $[r,[orderamount]]$. $r$ is a vector of the order amounts for all suppliers except the one with the greatest lead time. $S$ represents the \"order up to amount\". orderamount is calculated by calculating $S - I$ where $I$ is the current on-hand inventory. This value is then made 0 if it is negative or is reduced to the $maxorder$ if it is greater. This order amount is used for the supplier with the greatest lead time."
