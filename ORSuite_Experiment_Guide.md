## ORSuite Experiment Guide
ORSuite is a collection of environments, agents, and instrumentation, aimed at providing researchers in computer science and operations research reinforcement learning implementation of various problems and models arising in operations research. These experiments are made up of several componets including:

- importing packages
- specifying environment
- picking agent list
- running experiment/generating figures

This guide will go through how to read and run experiments made by ORSuite. 

# Experimental Parameters

Each of the environments have different paramenters. Most of the experiments have similar attributs, which can be found in the attributes section of `or_suite/experiment/experiment.py`.
