# ORSuite Experiment Guide
ORSuite is a collection of environments, agents, and instrumentation, aimed at providing researchers in computer science and operations research reinforcement learning implementation of various problems and models arising in operations research. These experiments are made up of several componets including package installation, specifying environments, picking the agent list, and generating figures while running the experiment.
The main components of running an experiment include: 

- importing packages
- specifying environment
- picking agent list
- running experiment/generating figures
