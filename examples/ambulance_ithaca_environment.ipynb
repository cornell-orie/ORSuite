    "# Ambulance Routing Ithaca Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential application of reinforcement learning involves positioning a server or servers (in this case an ambulance) in an optimal way geographically to respond to incoming calls while minimizing the distance traveled by the servers. This is closely related to the [k-server problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-server_problem), where there are $k$ servers stationed in a space that must respond to requests arriving in that space in such a way as to minimize the total distance traveled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ambulance routing problem addresses the problem by modeling an environment where there are ambulances stationed at locations, and calls come in that one of the ambulances must be sent to respond to. The goal of the agent is to minimize both the distance traveled by the ambulances between calls and the distance traveled to respond to a call by optimally choosing the locations to station the ambulances. The ambulance environment has been implemented in two different ways; as a 1-dimensional number line $[0,1]$ along which ambulances will be stationed and calls will arrive, and a graph with nodes where ambulances can be stationed and calls can arrive, and edges between the nodes that ambulances travel along.\n"

    "In this notebook, we walk through the Ambulance Routing problem with on a graph. There is a structured as a graph of nodes $V$ with edges between the nodes $E$. Each node represents a location where an ambulance could be stationed or a call could come in. The edges between nodes are undirected and have a weight representing the distance between those two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest ambulance to a call is determined by computing the shortest path from each ambulance to the call, and choosing the ambulance with the minimum length path. The calls arrive using a prespecified iid probability distribution. The default is for the probability of call arrivals to be evenly distributed over all the nodes; however, the user can also choose different probabilities for each of the nodes that a call will arrive at that node. For example, in the following graph the default setting would be for each call to have a 0.25 probability of arriving at each node, but the user could instead specify that there is a 0.1 probability of a call at node 0, and a 0.3 probability of a call arriving at each of the other three nodes.\n",
